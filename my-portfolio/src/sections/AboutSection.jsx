                Hey there! I'm a recent Computing Science graduate from the University of Groningen who genuinely enjoys building web applications and creating digital experiences. Beyond coding, I have a big passion for travelling, discovering new music, and outdoor sports.
            </p>
            
            <p className='about-text'> 
                Currently, I'm working as a full-stack developer at Avodah Creatives, where I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI components that power their frontend platform. I focus on ensuring our applications meet web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience that everyone can enjoy.
            </p>
            
            <p className='about-text'> 
                During my internships at Klippa and Hospital Lus√≠adas, I got hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development, learning how to create systems that people actually use every day. Throughout my bachelor's, I enjoyed diving into different programming languages and turning theoretical knowledge into working projects that I could see in action.
            </p>
            
            <p className='about-text'> 
                Beyond tech, I also have entrepreneurial experience from founding Project Umbra, a music event company that focused on bringing low-cost music events to the international community in Groningen. It served as a space to showcase local and young talents in Groningen's electronic music scene, where we organized 20+ events, hosting up to 700 people per event. In my free time, I enjoy surfing and going to the beach, watching football, discovering new movies and music, and DJing.
            </p>
            
            <p className='about-text'> 
                I bring a combination of technical expertise, entrepreneurial spirit, and a proven ability to thrive in diverse, international environments. With my adaptability to new technologies and collaborative mindset, I'm excited to contribute to innovative development projects in dynamic, forward-thinking teams.
            </p>
